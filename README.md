# Marketing Analytics(Using SQL, Python and Power BI) #
## Objective ##
To use marketing analytics to identify the factors behind ShopEasy’s reduced customer engagement, low conversion rates, and suboptimal customer feedback, and to provide data-driven recommendations that improve customer engagement, increase conversion rates, and enhance customer satisfaction while optimising marketing costs.

## Challenges ##
1. Reduced Customer Engagement – Declining interactions with website and marketing content.

2. Decreased Conversion Rates – Visitors are not converting into paying customers.

3. High Marketing Expenses – Increased spending on campaigns without expected ROI.

4. Need for Customer Feedback Analysis – Lack of insights from reviews/social media to improve

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) ##
### Conversion Rate:
Percentage of website visitors who make a purchase.

### Customer Engagement Rate:
Level of interaction with marketing content (clicks, likes, comments).

### Average Order Value (AOV):
Average amount spent by a customer per transaction.

### Customer Feedback Score:
Average rating from customer reviews.

## My Approach ## 
### 1. Data Extraction with SQL:
Performed data cleaning and created separate tables for structured datasets.
### 2. Joined Tables:

Combined multiple datasets (e.g., customer details, transaction logs, marketing data) using JOIN queries.

Ensured relationships (like CustomerID, ProductID) were used to merge records accurately.

### 3. Separated Key Records

Extracted specific fields into separate tables for clarity and analysis.

#### Example:
Comments Table → customer feedback, reviews.

Views Table → page views, clicks, impressions.

Transactions Table → orders, conversions, payments.

### Sentiment Analysis (Python in VS Code)

Imported cleaned data into Python environment.

Applied sentiment analytics using Python libraries (e.g., NLTK, TextBlob, or similar).

### Data Visualisation (Power BI)

Imported processed data from SQL Server into Power BI.

Designed interactive dashboards to visualize insights (engagement trends, conversion funnel, customer feedback patterns).
